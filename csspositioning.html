        <h1>Block vs Inline alignment</h1>
        <p>Earlier in the semester you were introduced to the concept of
                    <kbd>block</kbd> and <kbd>inline</kbd> elements. Blocks flow
                    vertically down the page by default, and inline flows horizontally across.
                    You were also shown how to center both inline and block elements.
                    Let's review that again now. Follow the activity instructions to make this poem flow down the page.</p>

          <h2>I am the cracked window you've yet to replace</h2>
          <p>That old hurt you haven't forgotten</p>
          <p> I'm the gentle wind that caresses your face</p>
          <p>I am the peach that felt ripe, but was rotten</p>

        <section class="block2">
          <p>I'm the bone that was broken and has still yet to heal;</p>
          <p> The body undiscovered in the landfill</p>
          <p>But I can be like the bliss of your favorite hot meal</p>

        <section class="block3">
          <p> Like the time you still had left to kill </p>
          <p>Like the match that you find in the darkest of days</p>
          <p> I will try to ward off all your fears</p>

          <p> I'm the one that's infected but death never came</p>
          <p> And despite all the odds, I'm still here</p>

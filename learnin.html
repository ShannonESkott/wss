<!--css stands for "cascading style sheets"-->
<!--html is about structure, css is all about presentation/style-->
<!--this is a way to set up a common rule for multiple parts of the page-->
<!--css is the difference between the first weeks project and an actual finished page w graphics n stuff-->
<!--"in-line css" is trying to style a page without css, only using html-->
<!--css is kind of like a function in python, something that can be used in multiple areas. css is best to set up in a separate file so each html page can call back to it without posting the code over and over again-->
<!--you can have multiple css files for one page-->
<!--css files will be referenced in the head part of the page-->
<!--the reference will likely look like: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> -->
<!--in css files, comments are surrounded by /* insert comment here */ so be sure to remember that-->

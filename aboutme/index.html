    <h2>Shannon Elizabeth Skott</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Shannon Skott, and I come from the middle of nowhere in Kentucky. I grew up on a farm and thus have a lot of experience dealing with animals, which I love very dearly. I arrived at BYU-Idaho in the Summer of 2022, and this is my second full semester. I am currently majoring in CIT, but that might change depending on how much Geology calls to me. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life, but I had very few friends who were in the same boat or cared as much, so coming to BYU-I has been a wonderful experience for me.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include reading, writing, character design, and playing games, both physical and digital. I've gotten into DnD lately, as I really like the socialization and chance to create stories for new characters, though I'm not the most strategic player. I also enjoy meeting new people and making friends, I love to learn about the experiences of others, despite my tendency to talk far too much about myself. I hope to learn a lot from this class, I already have grown a much greater appreciation for the work that goes into Web Design, and I look forward to what else will be taught.</p>

        <h1>Shannon Elizabeth Skott</h1>
        <h3>CIT Major</h3>
        <p class="p1">My name is Shannon Elizabeth Skott, I am 20 years old and I was born in California, but I've lived most of my life on a farm in Kentucky, which is why my social skills are borderline feral.</p>
        <p class="p2">I enjoy art and writing, I'm particularly interested in character studies, and I am overall very enthusiastic about life. I'm interested in Geology as of now, I've been steadily collecting rocks and I don't know what to do with them, so now I just have a bucket of rocks under my bed. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my entire life, though I've only developed a good testimony in the last ten years, and I'm really grateful for it. I'm especially grateful to get to interact with others my age who love the gospel, as I did not have that growing up.</p>

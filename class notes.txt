one has to understand and know what SPECIFIC audience they are marketing to. If you are too general, you will have a near impossible task of advertising something EVERYONE wants, which is impossible. A jack of all trades master of none does not work in web development.
you cannot market to everyone. You need to pick a niche and go with it.
if you chase every audience at the same time, you are unlikely to attract any of them. 
this also applies to color choice, ie. college students are more attracted to bright colors, nature lovers are more attracted to natural greens and browns. 
the audience you pick determines EVERYTHING. style, font, colors, information, format, advertisement strategies, etc
audience is everything.
personification- essentially imagine the ideal client and imagine what would appeal to their interests. example: Jane Haslotsamoney, a rich lady who loves her fur-baby(dog) would be attracted to "pets welcome" signs and exotic treats for her dog, as well as employees who are personable and ask about her dog. 
ONE audience, TWO personas.

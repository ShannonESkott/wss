Practice looking critically at websites
Learn basic design principles including the importance of color and typography choice in design-->
<!--CSS:-->
<!--css stands for "cascading style sheets"-->
<!--html is about structure, css is all about presentation/style-->
<!--this is a way to set up a common rule for multiple parts of the page-->
<!--css is the difference between the first weeks project and an actual finished page w graphics n stuff-->
<!--"in-line css" is trying to style a page without css, only using html-->
<!--css is kind of like a function in python, something that can be used in multiple areas. css is best to set up in a separate file so each html page can call back to it without posting the code over and over again-->
<!--you can have multiple css files for one page-->
<!--css files will be referenced in the head part of the page-->
<!--the reference will likely look like: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> -->
<!--in css files, comments are surrounded by /* insert comment here */ so be sure to remember that-->

<!--SITE PLANNING:
this week we created a repository in github, which is a way for the internet to store and access the information for a webpage globally rather than locally. 
We will be developing a site plan, which is essentially the vision of how we want our site to be, containing elements like:
    Statement of purpose and goals
    Definition of audience
    Personas and scenarios (Who will use the site and how will they use it?)
    A style guide:
    Branding information (how to use the branding for the site correctly)
    Typography choices and justification
    Color palette
    Specific styling of elements on the site (headings, lists, paragraphs, forms, links, buttons, and so on)
    A site map
    Wireframes showing general layout and content for major pages-->



    <!--around the content block, there are 3 surrounding bits; padding goes around the block, border goes around padding, and margin goes around border.-->
    <!--for putting the pixel numbers, if you give two different numbers, the first will be vertical pixels, the second is horizontal pixels.-->
